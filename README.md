A repository of our custom stylesheets for various websites

We strongly recommend using these with the Userstyle manager [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), available for Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. We suggest this because we use Stylus' inline JavaScript implementation for some themes. Please refer to the table below for more information.

|**Theme**|**Stylus**|
|-------|-------|
|Unified Spotify|**REQUIRED**|
|Unified Discord|**REQUIRED**|
|Canvas Dark|OPTIONAL|
