A repository of our custom stylesheets for various websites

You MUST have [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) installed to use these themes. They ***will not function*** without it\
Alternatives like "Stylish" do not work either, as some features we rely heavily on are only available on Stylus

Stylus is available for Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and many more. Check out their work!

## INSTALL LINKS

Please use these links to install the styles, GitHub will not provide automatic updates!
