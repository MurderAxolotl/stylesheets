A repository of our custom stylesheets for various websites

We strongly recommend using these with the Userstyle manager [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus), available for Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. We suggest this because we use Stylus' inline JavaScript implementation for some themes.

## INSTALL LINKS

Please use these links to install the styles, GitHub will not provide automatic updates!
