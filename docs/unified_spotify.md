First thing's first: this theme will have a LOT of issues if your display language isn't English. I'm doing my best to improve this situation, but unfortunately I can't do much about it

## FAQ

### *I found an issue! What do I do?*

First, check if there are any updates available. If there are, install them!

If there are no updates, or the issue isn't fixed, you can either [open an issue](https://github.com/MurderAxolotl/stylesheets/issues/new/choose) or fix it yourself and open a pull request

### *How do I fix this issue I found?*

If you have experience with CSS and know how to use devtools, feel free to poke around Spotify's DOM and figure out how to fix the issue yourself. If possible, try NOT to use class names / IDs, these are randomized
